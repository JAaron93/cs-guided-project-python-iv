If each slot in memory holds 8 bits and we want to store an array of 64-bit integers, how many memory addresses
will be required to store an array of 5 integers?
'''

# Answer:
# 32
# Note: This is because we have two numbers, 0 & 1, to work with and decimal places to count up to that double as
#  another decimal place is added. Thus the equation is 2**5
